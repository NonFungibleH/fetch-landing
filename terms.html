    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p class="policy-date">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before installing or using the Fetch Chrome extension ("the extension", "the service"). By installing Fetch, you agree to be bound by these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. About Fetch</h2>
    <p>Fetch is a free browser extension that automatically retrieves and displays publicly available shipping costs, free delivery thresholds, and returns policies from online retailer websites. It is provided free of charge.</p>

    <h2>2. Accuracy of information</h2>
    <p>Fetch retrieves information from retailer websites automatically using pattern recognition. While we aim to provide accurate results:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness or currency of the information displayed.</li>
      <li>Shipping costs, free delivery thresholds and returns policies may change at any time without notice.</li>
      <li>Always verify shipping and returns information directly with the retailer before completing a purchase.</li>
      <li>We accept no liability for any loss or inconvenience arising from reliance on information displayed by Fetch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use Fetch only for its intended purpose — to view publicly available shipping and returns information for personal shopping use. You must not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Fetch for any unlawful purpose.</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile or modify the extension.</li>
      <li>Use Fetch to scrape or systematically harvest data from retailer websites at scale.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the normal operation of any website or service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Affiliate relationships</h2>
    <p>Fetch may participate in affiliate marketing programmes. When you click the "Continue shopping" button, your browser may be redirected via an affiliate tracking link. This may result in us earning a small commission if you make a purchase. There is no additional cost to you. Affiliate relationships do not influence the shipping information displayed — Fetch reads retailer pages objectively.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-party websites</h2>
    <p>Fetch interacts with third-party retailer websites to retrieve publicly available information. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy, privacy practices, or terms of any third-party website. Your use of those websites is governed by their own terms and policies.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>The Fetch name, logo, and extension code are our intellectual property. You may not use our branding without prior written consent. The shipping information displayed within the extension is sourced from retailer websites and belongs to those respective retailers.</p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
    <p>Fetch is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the extension will be error-free, uninterrupted, or compatible with all websites or browser versions. Use of Fetch is at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, arising out of or in connection with your use of Fetch.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to the extension or terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend or discontinue Fetch at any time without notice. We may also update these Terms and Conditions at any time. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing law</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about these Terms and Conditions, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store listing or our GitHub repository.</p>
